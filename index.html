        <p class="bio">
            I am 22 years old and have lived in West Chester Pennsylvania for nearly my entire life. Even at an early age
            I loved solving puzzles and playing strategy games like Age of Empires, and later Chess.
            In school, my favorite subjects were always math and science. I liked the fact that in those classes there
            were definite, concrete answers that could be proven and backed by data. That might be why I have drawn such
            an interest
            in programming. When your creating your site or application, there might be multiple pathways of getting to
            your desired
            outcome, but ulimately it either works, or it doesn't.

        <p class="bio"> As I got older, I started to take a real interest in fitness and nutrition.
            I started lifting weights near the end of high school and to my surprise my mood, posture and outlook really
            started to change for the better. I started playing basketball at my local gym and really loved the
            combination
            the physical demand along with being on a team, and making quick mental decisions. I started watching
            basketball
            on television and then followed the Philadelphia 76ers and became a huge fan almost instantaneously.
